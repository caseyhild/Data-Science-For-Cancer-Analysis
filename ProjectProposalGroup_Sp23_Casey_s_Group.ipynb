    "Social factors are one aspect that have an effect on an individual’s health [1]. Some of these factors include education, employment status, income, and culture [1]. We seek to examine what role these social factors play with regards to cancer rates and cancer deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some researchers have discussed the socioeconomic disparities in cancer screening participation, such as cervical and breast cancer screening. However, some cultural and economic barriers remain to be overcome. According to some studies, low-income and low-education women are less likely to participate in breast cancer screening than women from higher social levels. Similarly, women from low socioeconomic status had a higher risk of cervical cancer but lower Pap smear screening.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Other studies also discuss disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates based on race/ethnicity and poverty levels in the county or census tract of residence, showing that more impoverished counties have higher death rates from cancer, and people living in more impoverished census tracts have lower five-year survival rates.[3]\n",

    "We expect that lower socioeconomic status is correlated with a higher cancer rate and cancer deaths, as people in this group would have less disposable income and therefore less access to the necessary medical resources to mitigate the risks of cancer, such as medical screenings. Additionally, people with a lower level of education may not be fully aware of the risk factors of cancer and the implications of cancer."
